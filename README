				zzdicom -- quick and dirty DICOM tools
				======================================

The zzdicom package consists of a few fast and lightweight tools for reading, writing, verifying 
and anonymizing DICOM data. They were written for practical use when and where I had need of them,
not for correctness or completeness.

Limitations
-----------
zzdicom currently only works on little-endian architectures, and only with little-endian DICOM
data. I have never encountered big-endian DICOM data in the real world (ie hospital settings), so
I never saw a need for adding support for this. It compiles out of the box on Linux, but it should
work on other architectures, but you may need to remove the -DPOSIX define from the Makefile first.

Features
--------
The software was written with performance as a high priority, and the little it does, it does far
faster than any other DICOM software that I have tested.

The tools
---------
zzanon - an in-place DICOM anonymizer. It *changes* the files you list, overwriting the tags it
recognizes as containing patient identifying information. It will not change *anything else*, 
including the relative positioning of any tags in the file. This is to retain the file exactly
as it was, including any esoteric errors the file might contain. Too many other anonymizer tools
will parse the file before copying it out again, accidentially fixing several classes of errors
on the way.

zzverify - will run through the files listed to check for various errors. If any are found, they
are listed on standard out.

zzdump - will dump a list of tags for each DICOM file given.
