General:
* zzwCopy() does not work with UN tags in explicit syntax, no ladder tracking yet
* Part6 DICOM files with no Group Length available in Meta Information Header 
  will fail (try with gdcmData/DermaColorLossLess.dcm). Not sure if it is worth
  trying to handle files this broken. Both DCMTK and GDCM handle them, though.
  See also gdcmData/MARCONI_MxTWin-12-MONO2-JpegLossless-ZeroLengthSQ.dcm
* Private or bad VRs are not handled well. Here we may have to guess the length
  of the length field. See gdcmData/DMCPACS_ExplicitImplicit_BogusIOP.dcm which
  cannot be read by DCMTK but is handled by GDCM. Also see
  gdcmData/ExplicitVRforPublicElementsImplicitVRforShadowElements.dcm
* Wrong length items not handled, may not want to even try; gdcm handles it,
  see gdcmData/GE_GENESIS-16-MONO2-WrongLengthItem.dcm
* gdcmData/IM-0001-0066.dcm has something strange after its pixel data, but
  neither gdcm nor dcmtk reads it fine
* UN tags of defined size containing an SQ element is not iterated through in 
  implicit mode, since we do not know what is inside (see impl.dcm, and
  gdcmData/PET-cardio-Multiframe-Papyrus.dcm), we should check the tag table
  and set value to 'SQ' before calling zziternext()
